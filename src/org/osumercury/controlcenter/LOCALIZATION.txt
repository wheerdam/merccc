MERCURY CONTROL CENTER
Program Output Localization

Revision History:
0.9.9  2016-12-04  Initial version

Certain text in the Mercury Control Center program can be replaced during runtime for localization purposes. To localize the text in the DISPLAY WINDOW, add a [localization] section in the configuration file. The following entries then can be used to localize the string:

Key              Default (English)
----------------------------------
TEAM             TEAM 
SETUP_PERIOD     SETUP PERIOD
TIME_LEFT        TIME LEFT
SETUP_TIME_LEFT  SETUP TIME LEFT
RUN              RUN
OF               OF
NEXT             NEXT
CURRENT          CURRENT
NO_SCORE         NO SCORE
BEST_SCORE       BEST SCORE
CLASSIFICATION   CLASSIFICATION
POSITION         P.
ID               ID
SCORE            SCORE

As an example, to replace the word "TEAM" with "ROBOT", and "CLASSIFICATION" with "STANDINGS", one can use the following localization section in the configuration file:

	[localization]
	TEAM=ROBOT
	CLASSIFICATION=STANDINGS
